§000 Preamble

  The Pleiades Watchtower License (often abbreviated in this document to PWL)
is a set of permissive but simultaneously protective/paranoid terms and
conditions that allow primarily for free (as in freedom) usage of protected
works.

  This license guarantees both productive contributions and freedom while
simultaneously giving the copyright holder more control over their work, as
well as some sane protections should they decide to change any terms or
protect themselves from rogue contributors.

  Art is art. The form of art is irrelevant, it can be musical, it can be a
circuit design, it can be a series of computer processor instructions, or it
could be practically anything else.

  In the case of computer programming, everyone should have the freedom to
view your source code, modify your code and distribute it to others; However,
they should not be permitted to outright "steal" your work and claim it as
their own creation. They should be advised against taking your work, improving
on it and preventing you from using those changes with a different license, and
so on. Most importantly, if you decide to change the terms, your changes should
have consistent and powerful weight, as you are the original artist.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

§001 Glossary

  * The "Object" or the "Project"
    
      When referring to an "Object," we refer to the copyrighted work that is
    protected under this license. This can take any form, such as a programming
    library, computer program, musical composition, compiled binary, etc. This
    document is to be distributed "alongside" the Object, and applies to any
    and all parts of the Object.
    
  * The "License Master"
  
      The License Master is the entity that produced the original Object. This
    title can be transferred elsewhere, and such an act is classified as a
    modification of the license terms. Any open source contributions made to
    the Object by other contributors become a part of the Object, and are thus
    belong to the License Master.
    
      If the Object is copied and modified in such a way that the changes are
    not given back to the original Object's source project (referred to in some
    cases as "remixing" or "fair use"), the entity that modified the original
    Object then becomes the License Master of the new, modified Object. For
    this exception to be applicable, the aforementioned entity must modify the
    original Object to an acceptable degree, such that it may be considered
    "fair use." A modified version of the original Object becomes "fair use"
    when it is considered impossible to merge the changes made to the original
    Object back into the original Object's source, or the original License
    Master or their chosen project maintainers refuses to accept your changes
    to the Object.
    
  * A "contributor"
  
      A contributor refers to an entity who has modified the original Object
    and wishes to give their changes back to the providers/producers of the
    original Object such that the original Object now contains the changes
    (or a form of the changes) supplied by the contributor.
    
      When an entity modifies the original Object, that modified version
    belongs to the modifying entity. Only the changes made belong to them,
    however. Everything written or "owned" by the original License Master still
    belongs to the original License Master, and any terms detailed by the
    original License Master apply to the work that belongs to them. There must
    be a clear distinction between the License Master's original work and the
    work provided by the modifying entity until it is merged back into the
    original Object. This essentially means that any changes made to the
    original Object are not owned, created by or belong to the original License
    Master until/unless they accept those changes as belonging to their
    original Object.
    
§002 No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Object, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Object.
    
§003 Limitation of Liability, Disclaimer of Warranty and Interpretation.
    
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE OBJECT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE OBJECT "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE OBJECT
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE OBJECT PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE OBJECT AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE OBJECT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE Object TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER OBJECTS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Object, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Object in return for a fee.
